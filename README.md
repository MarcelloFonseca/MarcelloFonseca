👋 Hi, I’m @MarcelloFonseca

👀 I’m interested in integrating cutting-edge AI and machine learning technologies into the wellness and yoga industry. Passionate about developing innovative digital solutions that enhance the yoga experience, I focus on creating platforms that are both user-friendly and technologically advanced.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about advanced computer vision techniques and generative AI models to further refine our intelligent yoga instructor system. Always keen on exploring new ways AI can be leveraged to personalize and improve health and wellness practices.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that blend technology with wellness, particularly those that aim to make health practices more accessible, engaging, and effective through digital innovation. Keen on partnerships that push the boundaries of what's possible in the intersection of tech and yoga.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me via email at marcellof@eogalife.com or reach out on LinkedIn. I'm always open to discussing new ideas, opportunities for collaboration, or just exchanging thoughts on the future of technology in wellness.
